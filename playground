Great Horned Owl
Based on a poem by SALLIE WOLF
An eagle once sat in my tree
at day (when most birds cannot see).
But when the sun rose,
he was found by some crows,
and their caws caused the owl to flee, or did they?

Somebody Once Told Me 
The World Was Gonna Roll Me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kinda dumb
With her finger and her thumb
in the shape of an L
on her forehead

Well the years start coming
And they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules so I hit the ground running
Didn't have time not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
so much to do
so much to see
so what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
You never know if you dont go
You never shine if you dont glow
