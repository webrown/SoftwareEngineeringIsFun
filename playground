Great Horned Owl
Based on a poem by SALLIE WOLF
STUPID EAGLES.
An elephant once sat in my tree
at day (when most birds cannot see).
printf(But when the sun rose);
he was found by some crows,
and their caws caused the owl to flee, or did they?
ayy lmao
nervously trying to escape, the owl did fly away.
It landed and turned its head ominously,
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
