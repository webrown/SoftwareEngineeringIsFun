Great Horned Owl
Based on a poem by SALLIE WOLF
An eagle once sat in my tree
at day (when most birds cannot see).
But when the sun rose,
he was found by some crows,
and their caws caused the owl to flee, or did they?

The One Ring
J. R. R. Tolkien
Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,
Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
One Ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them,
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
