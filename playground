Great Horn Owl
Based on a peom by KUSH PATEL
STUPID EAGLES.
An bald eagle/elephant once sat in my tree
at day
printf(But when the sun rose);
he was found by some crows,
and their caws caused the owl to flee, or did they?
Yes, they did cause the owl to flee. That is the answer
ayy lmao
nervously trying to escape, the owl did fly away.
It landed and turned its head ominously,
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

The One Ring
J. R. R. Tolkien
Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,
Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
One Ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them,
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
