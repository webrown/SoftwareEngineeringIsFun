Great Horn Owl
Based on a peom by SALLIE WOLF
STUPID EAGLES.
An eagle/elephant once sat in my tree
at day (when most birds cannot see).
printf(But when the sun rose);
he was found by some crows,
and their caws caused the owl to flea, or did they?
ayy lmao
nervously trying to escape, the owl did fly away.
It landed and turned its head ominously,
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
